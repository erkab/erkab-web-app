### Developed by Hesham Saleh ([@etchsaleh](http://www.github.com/etchsaleh)) and Omar Khaled ([@omarkhaledabdo](http://www.github.com/omarkhaledabdo))

**Erkab** is a ride sharing website designed specifically for college students. 
The solution initially stemmed from the inadequate number of parking spaces available within campus and the aim to reduce traffic congestion within the area.

### It is...
* ***Safe.*** We make sure that only students are allowed to register by verifying thier college ID and contact info.
* ***Cost Effective.*** Erkab is significantly cheaper than Uber<sup><b>1</b></sup> and other similar services.
* ***Fun.*** It's a great way to meet and know your fellow students at university.

<sup><b>1</b></sup> Based on fare estimates obtained from the [Uber API](https://developer.uber.com/docs/riders/references/api/v1.2/estimates-price-get).

**Technologies used:** JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, jQuery, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Maps API, Twilio API.
